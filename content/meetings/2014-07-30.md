ChicagoLUG Certification Prep: Session One
==========================================

This will be the first formal session in our ongoing Linux Certification
Prep series. We'll be meeting on Wednesday, July 30th in the first-floor
lounge of [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html).
Our discussions will begin at 6:30pm, and we anticipate that this session will
run until about 8:00-8:30.

Meeting Agenda & Request for RSVP
---------------------------------

At our last meeting we agreed to work from the
[LPI](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications) series of
certifications, starting with the
[Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/entry-level-credential/linux-essentials)
material, and proceeding to the information in the
[LPIC-1](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-1) and
[LPIC-2](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-2) exam
objectives. We will be continuing through the *Essentials* material
during this meeting.

Space is limited to 20 participants, so please RSVP on our [meetup
page](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Linux-Users-Group/events/197440622/)
so we know who will be attending.

### If You Can't Make It

Not everyone will be able to attend every session, so it is the
responsibility of attendees to take good notes.

We'll be taking collaborative notes on our LUG Etherpad, and will make
the notes available after the meeting.

### Official Statement of Welcomeness

Everyone is welcome regardless of skill level. Yes, some people have
more experience than others, but we can all learn from each other. These
will be *group* learning sessions. We hope to see you soon!
