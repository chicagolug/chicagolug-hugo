## Using Linux Applications with Flatpak

We'll start out with a presentation from Meg Ford on
[Flatpak](http://flatpak.org/). FlatPak is a new framework for creating
distribution-agnostic sandboxed Linux desktop applications. FlatPak uses
features such as Project Atomicâ€™s bubblewrap utility, systemd cgroups, D-Bus,
and OSTree. Meg will give a high-level overview of the features FlatPak
provides to users, and demonstrate installing and running a simple example
application.

## Copperhead OS - Security-Focused Android

As a follow-up, Jim Campbell will be presenting on
[Copperhead OS](https://copperhead.co), a security-focused variant of the
Android operating system. We'll get an overview of how it is different from
stock Android and other custom Android roms.

In addition, you'll come away with an understanding of how the Copperhead team
has hardened the OS, a roster of useful free software Android applications from
the F-Droid repository, and the encouragement and information needed to give
this security and privacy-respecting Android variant a try yourself.

### RSVP

RSVP's are not required, but are encouraged to help us with planning our food
order for the event. You can RSVP on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/wclug-org/events/236815190/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
