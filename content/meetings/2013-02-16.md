Our next meeting is set for Saturday, February 16th, starting at
12:00pm, and we have a great set of talks lined up for this meeting.

[Meg Ford](http://fordmeg.blogspot.com/) will be reporting on the
outcomes from the recent GNOME developertools hackfest in Belgium. There
was much discussion at the hackfest around GObject bindings, dynamic vs.
statically typed languages, and debugging large applications written in
dynamic languages. Meg will provide the scoops on all of it.

[Michael Larabel](http://www.michaellarabel.com/) will be giving a talk
on the
[Wayland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_%28display_server_protocol)
Display Server. Michael has covered the development of Wayland as part
of his reporting for [Phoronix](http://www.phoronix.com), and should
have much to share with us.

Following-up on prior meetings, we may also include a lightning talk or
two on Emacs. We will include these as time permits.

As usual, the event will be at Chicago's Pumping Station: One, located
at 3519 North Elston in Chicago. Talks and speaking order are subject to
change.

People of all ability levels are welcome to join us, learn more
GNU/Linux, and contribute. If you have any questions, feel free to be in
touch via our mailing list or any of our social media channels.
