## Running a Truly Open Source Android Stack

In 2008, open source enthusiasts rejoiced as Google released Android as an
open source mobile operating system. However, ten years later, Google has
been able to maintain control over Android by gradually releasing
application updates and API extensions under proprietary licenses. Google
Play Services is of particular concern, with many, if not most Android
applications requiring this proprietary API. This talk will show you how
you can run a very functional Android environment with almost no proprietary
code, giving you more control over your private information and other data.

Specifically, this talk will go over general Android architecture, LineageOS,
a feature called Signature Spoofing, and MicroG. It will cover why you should
use these tools and projects and how to install them. Finally, if time
permits, I'll cover open source replacements for your favorite Android
applications, how to transfer Signal data between phones, and how to make bit
for bit backups of your Android operating system and data.

eviljoel has been a Linux user for 15 years and has been attending Chicago
Linux User Group meetings for 10 years. He is an open source enthusiast and
privacy advocate. He works as a Java programmer at a Chicago based computer
security company.

### RSVP

If this sounds good to you and you plan to join us, kindly RSVP. RSVP's are
not required, but are encouraged to help us with planning our food order for
the event. You can RSVP on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/chicagolug/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
