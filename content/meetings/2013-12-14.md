We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, December 14th, starting
at 12:00pm. We'll be meeting at our regular spot,
[Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/psone312/).

Speaking Topics
---------------

Bonnie King will discuss
[Red Hat Software Collections](http://www.zdnet.com/keeping-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-current-7000020688/),
and how they're packaged and used in Scientific Linux.

Jeff Schroeder will also discuss the
[Graphite Project](http://graphite.wikidot.com/start). Graphite stores numeric
time-series data, and render graphs of this data on demand.

Hacking . . . we will have none. Festivities . . . we will have them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike regular meetings, we will not be hacking. Instead, we'll have
holiday good times.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
