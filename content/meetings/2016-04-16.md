On Saturday, April 16th, members of the Chicago GNU/Linux User Group
along with [Shahid
Buttar](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/shahid-buttar) from the
[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) will co-host a
free workshop on surveillance self-defense. The workshop will be open to
the public, though particularly structured for activists and lawyers who
support social movements.

You are not expected to be a technical expert to attend this session -
it is geared towards regular smartphone and laptop users. We will be
sharing knowledge of surveillance, some immediate and practical steps
you can take to protect your communications, and how to work with
neighbors to influence surveillance policy at the state and local level.

To get the most out of the event, we recommend that you bring your phone
and/or laptop.

The event will take place at [SPACE](http://space.doejo.com/), located
at [444 N. Wabash Ave](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3575222994) in
downtown Chicago. The session will start at 11:00am, and will last
approximately four hours. We recommend that you take public transit to
attend the event. SPACE is conveniently located near the Grand Avenue
stop on the CTA Red Line, and is wheelchair accessible. Pizza and other
refreshments will be served.

There is no cost to attend, but we encourage (though not require) that
you RSVP so that we may plan accordingly. And feel free share this
event, too! Registrations are handled [via the EFF
website](https://www.eff.org/04-16-16-CHI). We look forward to seeing
you on April 16th!

Special Notes
-------------

Legal professionals licensed to practice in Illinois will have an
opportunity to receive Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE)
credit for a $25 cost.

We will have vegetarian food options available. If you prefer a vegan,
gluten free, or other food option, please send an email to
<tux@chicagolug.org> with your request.
