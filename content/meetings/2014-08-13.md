ChicagoLUG Certification Prep: Session Two
==========================================

This will be the second formal session in our biweekly Linux
Certification Prep series. We'll be meeting on Wednesday, August 13th at

at [430 North Michigan Avenue](https://goo.gl/maps/RLcYT). Our
discussions will begin at 6:30pm, and we anticipate that this session
will run until about 8:00-8:30.

Meeting Agenda & Request for RSVP
---------------------------------

We will continue to work through the
[LPI](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications) series of certification
objectives, starting with the
[Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/entry-level-credential/linux-essentials)
material, and proceeding to the information in the
[LPIC-1](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-1) and
[LPIC-2](https://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-2) exam
objectives. Notes from our prior meeting are available on our
[Etherpad](https://etherpad.chicagolug.org/p/certs-2014-07-30) (username
/ password: chicagolug / chicagolug).

Space is limited to 20 participants, so please RSVP on our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Linux-Users-Group/events/199547982/)
so we know who will be attending.

### If You Can't Make It

Not everyone will be able to attend every session, so it is the
responsibility of attendees to take good notes.

We'll continue to take collaborative notes on our LUG Etherpad, and will
make the notes available after the meeting.

### Official Statement of Welcomeness

Everyone is welcome regardless of skill level. Yes, some people have
more experience than others, but we can all learn from each other. These
will be *group* learning sessions. We hope to see you soon!
