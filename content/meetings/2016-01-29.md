Join members of the ChicagoLUG for informal hacking and coffee drinking
at *Programming Tonight: January Edition*. Bring a project to work on
and a few dollars for some coffee and a tasty sandwich. Get to know your
fellow LUG members in an informal, working session.

The gathering is set for Friday, January 29th, starting at 7:00pm. We'll
be meeting at [New Wave
Coffee](https://chicagolug.org/locations/new-wave-coffee.html), located
at [2557 North Milwaukee Avenue](http://ur1.ca/glmp1).

You're welcome to bring any project that you'd like, or to bring no
project at all and hope to find one once you get there.
