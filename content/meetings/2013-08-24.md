We've scheduled our August meeting for Saturday, August 24th, starting
at 12:00pm at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html). Early birds typically
start showing up by about 11:40 or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Bonnie King of [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) will be giving a talk
on [Scientific Linux](https://www.scientificlinux.org/), a Linux
distribution built from publicly available open source SRPMS provided by
"a prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor." From the website,
"Scientific Linux is a Linux release put together by Fermilab,
[CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/), and various other labs and
universities around the world. Its primary purpose is to reduce
duplicated effort of the labs, and to have a common install base for the
various experimenters."

Gregorie Thomas will also present on basic linux server security.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but
feel free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us
know in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
