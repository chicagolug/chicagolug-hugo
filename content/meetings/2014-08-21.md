If you've had a full day of talks at LinuxCon, and want to unwind with
some friendly locals and good conversation, we've got just the spot.
Join some Chicago GNOME'rs for *GNOME Beers: LinuxCon Chicago Edition*.

What is GNOME Beers?
--------------------

People in different cities organize *GNOME Beers* events to get people
together to talk about GNOME. The events often feature lightning talks,
but folks will probably be Linuxed-out after a full day at LinuxCon, so
no lightning talks for us.

When and Where Will GNOME Beers Take Place?
-------------------------------------------

<div class="center">

We'll be getting together on Thursday, August 21st at 7:00pm. The
location is set as [Howells & Hood](http://www.howellsandhood.com/), a
restaurant and pub at 435 North Michigan Avenue.

Howells and Hood is about [a two-block walk](http://goo.gl/maps/xevzw)
from the LinuxCon hotel.
