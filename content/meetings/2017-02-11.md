Our February Meeting is set for Saturday, February 11th, starting at 2:00pm,
and we'll be meeting at the Pumping Station: One.


## Live network coding in 8sync

<img src="/img/meetings/8sync-logo-500px.png" alt="8sync Logo" style="float:right;">

Isn't network programming a pain?  Wouldn't it be nice if you could live code
and explore the system you're building as you go?  Enter *8sync*, an actor
model library for GNU Guile that's built to support evolving your networked
application as it runs.

This talk will exchew the traditional slide presentation model in favor of the
audience participating in an 8sync powered multiplayer game, where each room
serves as a "slide".  What other talk combines all the fun elements of network
hacking, multiplayer games, and choose your own adventure style exploring?

### RSVP

RSVP's are not required, but are encouraged to help us with planning our food
order for the event. You can RSVP on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/wclug-org/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
