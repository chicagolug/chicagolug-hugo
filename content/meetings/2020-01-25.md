Our January 2020 meeting is set for Saturday, January 20th, starting at 2:00pm,
We'll gather at
[Pumping Station: One](https://pumpingstationone.org/contact-2/).

We have two talks lined-up for this meeting, covering Linux on RISC-V and
systemd-homed.

## Linux on RISC-V

This is going to be an exciting meeting.  Drew will demo Linux running on
RISC-V on the Hackaday Supercon Badge, and talk about how we were able to
accomplish that using free software tools such as Linux-on-LiteX-VexRiscv and
KiCad.

Drew will also look at what's coming up in 2020 for Linux on RISC-V including
developments in the kernel, Fedora and Debian, plus what Linux-capable silicon
chips are on the horizon.

Jim will be presenting on one of the newer (and yet-to-be-merged) components of
systemd, systemd-homed. We'll take a look at some of the problems it aims to
solve, how it attempts to solve them, and when you'd want to use it / when
you'd not want to use it.

As always, this is a BYOB event and we will have pizza. RSVP's are encouraged
but not required. We look forward to seeing everyone there!


### RSVP

If this sounds good to you and you plan to join us, kindly RSVP. RSVP's are
not required, but are encouraged to help us with planning our food order for
the event. You can RSVP on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/chicagolug/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
