We're organizing a series of group sessions around certification prep,
and this will be our initial session. We'll be meeting at the Lincoln
Park [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/lincolnpark)
on Wednesday, July 16th at 6:30pm. We anticipate that this session will
run until about 8:00-8:30.

Meeting Agenda & Request for RSVP
---------------------------------

As this is our first session, we'll be discussing each members'
interests in pursuing a certification, assessing our collective level of
skill, and deciding what certifications we want to pursue.

Space is limited, so please RSVP on our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Linux-Users-Group/events/194335322/)
so we know who will be attending.
