BARcamp Chicago is Chicago's longest running unconference. It is a
conference focusing on technology and entrepreneurial topics that is
free and open to the public. All talks are given by the attendees of the
conference. The schedule and talks are determined the day of the event.
We have 3 tracks for talks: development, entrepreneurial, and
miscellaneous.
