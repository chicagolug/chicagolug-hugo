Members of ChicagoLUG will be participating at
[Flourish](http://flourishconf.com/2014/), an open-source conference
organized by students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. This
year's event will take place on Saturday, April 5th, [at the UIC
Campus](http://flourishconf.com/2014/directions.php).

The [conference schedule](http://flourishconf.com/2014/schedule.php) is
pretty packed. If you have some breaks between sessions, though, stop by
the [Mini-Expo](http://flourishconf.com/2014/miniexpo.php). We'll have a
booth there, and it would be great if you'd stop by and say hello.
