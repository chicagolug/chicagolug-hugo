May 2020 virtual meeting
========================

We've scheduled our May meeting for Saturday, May 2nd, starting
at 2:00pm. Due to the Covid19 outbreak, we will be meeting virtually.

Speaking Topics

We'll have presentations on both Racher's lightweight Kubernetes implementation, K3S,
and a technical overview of the Wireguard VPN server.

We're hosting this on what will be a short-lived, self-hosted instance of Big Blue
Button, and the meeting room is here:
