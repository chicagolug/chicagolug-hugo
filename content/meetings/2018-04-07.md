This will be hands-on meetup where we'll be working on our ChicagoLUG website
and related projects. If you're interested in learning about Ansible, Nginx,
Discourse, and / or Hugo, this will be a good time to meet other members of
ChicagoLUG and get your feet wet / hands dirty with these projects.

We'll work to Ansible-ize our website deployment, make some improvements to the
ChicagoLUG.org site layout / appearance, and start the process of porting our
Mailing List from GNU/Mailman to Discourse.

Beverages will be provided, and we'll be ordering pizza during the day. We look
forward to seeing you there!
