Our February 2018 meeting is set for Saturday, February 10th, starting at 2:00pm,
We'll gather at [Pumping Station: One](https://pumpingstationone.org/contact-2/).

## SecureDrop - Developing and hosting a security-critical web application

<img src="/img/meetings/securedrop-logo.png" alt="SecureDrop Logo" style="float:right;">

For this month we invite you to join
[Freddy Martinez](https://freedom.press/people/freddy-martinez/) and members
of the ChicagoLUG to learn about SecureDrop. SecureDrop is a free software
whistle-blower submission system that media organizations can use to securely
accept documents from, and communicate with, anonymous sources.

Freddy will share details about why this project exists, particularly in
addressing issues of mass surveillance and how surveillance impacts source
protection. He will cover the SecureDrop technical stack, some of the
approaches that developers take to harden the application, and will
also share some of the current and future work around the project.

In attending, you'll not only learn about SecureDrop, but will learn important
approaches in hardening security-critical applications.

### RSVP

If this sounds good to you and you plan to join us, kindly RSVP. RSVP's are
not required, but are encouraged to help us with planning our food order for
the event. You can RSVP on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/chicagolug/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
