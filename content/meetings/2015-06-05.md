The gathering is set for Friday, June 5th, starting at 7:00pm. We'll be
meeting at [New Wave Coffee](https://chicagolug.org/locations/new-wave-coffee.html),
located at [2557 North Milwaukee Avenue](http://ur1.ca/glmp1).

You're welcome to bring any project that you'd like, or to bring no
project at all and hope to find one once you get there.
