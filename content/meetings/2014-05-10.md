We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, May 10th, with formal
talks starting at 2:00 pm. We'll be meeting at the most excellent
hackerspace, [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html).

We're also likely to have time for working on projects together, and
will provide more info about that as we get closer to the meeting date.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Freddy Martinez will take us through building and deploying our own TOR
[middle relay](https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/what-is-tor). This marks
a continuation of rather technical, security and privacy related talks
at ChicagoLUG.

We'll have an additional speaker lined up in time for the meeting, but
our second speaker is currently TBD.

Foodstuffs
----------

We're going to be creative about footstuffs this month, venturing away
from the great but pricey [Pat's Pizza](http://patspizza.info/), and try
something new. Perhaps [Pizza Metro](http://pizzametro.com), as they
make a good pie and have some sweet coupons.

It's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza, but you aren't required to donate. You can also bring a
beverage to share if you want to.
