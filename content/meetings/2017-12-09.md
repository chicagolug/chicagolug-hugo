Our December Meeting is set for Saturday, December 9th, starting at 2:00pm,
and we'll be meeting at Pumping Station: One.


## How the DebConf video team uses Ansible

<img src="/img/meetings/ansible-logo-small.png" alt="Ansible Logo" style="float:right;">

Carl Karsten will provide a tour of how the DebConf video team provisions
their video recording hardware. Whether he is putting the installer and config
files onto bootable media, or serving it up using a PXE stack, Carl uses
Ansible to turn the new box into one of the many types of machines needed:
video mixer, frame grabber, encoder, nfs server, even the dhcp/pxe server
that hosts all the scripts to do all the things.

Carl will focus on the Ansible parts of this deployment. If you are new to
Ansible, maybe this will get you started. If you are an expert, you'll be able
to offer feedback on how things may be better.

### RSVP

If this sounds cool to you, you should RSVP. RSVP's are not required, but are
encouraged to help us with planning our food order for the event. You can
RSVP on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/chicagolug/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
