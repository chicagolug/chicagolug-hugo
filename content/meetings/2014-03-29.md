We've scheduled our next meeting for Saturday, March 29th, with formal
talks starting at 2:00 pm. We'll be meeting at our regular spot,
[Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html).

For those who are interested, we'll also have some time before the
meeting for some informal project hacking. The informal, pre-meeting
hacking will start at 12:00 pm. If you don't want to work on projects,
feel free to just show up close to 2:00 pm.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Brian Kroll will teach us about [arkOS](https://arkos.io), a Raspberry
Pi-based platform that allows you to host your own website, email,
“cloud” and more.

Joel Luellwitz will also take us through basic and advanced uses of
[GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/) and
[Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php).

Hacking
-------

We'll have time to hack on projects both before and after our talks.
Both hacking times are entirely optional.

Pre-meeting hacking will start at about noon. Bring something that
you've been working on, and others will be there to do work as well. We
can help each other or just work quietly.

Post-meeting hacking will take place after the talks. It can get a
little noisy after the talks, but you can still get stuff done if you're
focused. :)

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
