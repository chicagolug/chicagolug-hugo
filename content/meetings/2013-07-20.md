July 2013 meeting and hackfest of the ChicagoLUG
================================================  

We've scheduled our July meeting for Saturday, July 20th, starting at
12:00pm at [Pumping Station:One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html).
Early birds typically start showing up by about 11:40 or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

[William Giokas](http://git.kaictl.net/) will be giving a talk on the
rolling release distribution, [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).
Though William will provide an overview of Arch in general, he'll give
special attention to the Arch Linux package manager, *pacman*.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but
feel free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us
know in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
