We've scheduled our May meeting for Saturday, May 25th, starting at
12:00pm at [Pumping Station:
One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html). Early birds typically
start showing up by about 11:40 or so. If you're there early, just sit
tight. If you show up late, please knock loudly on the door so we can
hear you from upstairs.

Speaking Topics
---------------

William Giokas is set to talk on
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd), and George
Lesica is also tentatively set to speak on [R](http://r-project.org). We
will provide final confirmation as we get closer to the meeting date.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but
feel free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us
know in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the [GNOME
Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
