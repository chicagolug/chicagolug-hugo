Our June Meeting is set for Saturday, June 17th, starting at 2:00pm,
and we'll be meeting at the Pumping Station: One.


## OpenShift MiniShift

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by launching a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a virtual machine. With Minishift you can
try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local machine.

Bring whatever latop  you want because you can run Minishift on Windows, Mac OS,
and even GNU/Linux operating systems. Minishift uses libmachine for provisioning
virtual machines, and OpenShift Origin for running the cluster.

Sten Turpin of Red Hat will provide a walk-through demo of getting OpenShift
MiniShift up and running on your workstation, and will discuss some of its
common use cases.

## SecureDrop

SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media
organizations can use to securely accept documents from and communicate with
anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is
currently managed by Freedom of the Press Foundation.

Of course, it wouldn't do much good to deploy an instance of SecureDrop if
your instance wasn't very secure itself. Freddy Martinez of Lucy Parsons
Labs will discuss key considerations for securing, deploying and maintaining a
secure instance of SecureDrop.

### RSVP

If this sounds cool to you, you should RSVP. RSVP's are not required, but are
encouraged to help us with planning our food order for the event. You can
RSVP on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/chicagolug/).

### Foodstuffs

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we recommend
bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one will be
denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
