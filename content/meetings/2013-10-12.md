October 2013 meeting and hackfest
=================================

We've scheduled our October meeting for Saturday, October 12, starting
at 2:30pm at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/psone312/).
All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Freddy Martinez of
[Radicals Against Discrimination](https://twitter.com/ChicagoRADicals) will be
giving a talk on personal data security. Jim Campbell will be following-up
Freddy, leading a discussion around how we want to use new cloud server
resources that have been generously offered to us by a hosting provider.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will also hack on GNOME-related projects,
but feel free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us
know in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), but it's typically a
good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of pizza and
drinks.
