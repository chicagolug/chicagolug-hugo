Our next meeting is set for Saturday, March 23rd, starting at 12:00pm.
Joel Luellwitz will be presenting on Linux utilities, technologies and
best practices concerning authentication and security. Part of his focus
will be on what can go wrong if these tools are used improperly.

People of all ability levels are welcome to join us, learn more
Linux, and contribute. If you have any questions, feel free to be in
touch via our mailing list or any of our social media channels.
