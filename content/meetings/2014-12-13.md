The meeting is set for Saturday, December 13th, starting at 2:00pm.
We'll be meeting at [Pumping Station: One](http://chicagolug.org/locations/psone.html).

Speaking Topics
---------------

Andrew Spalding from 8th Light will give a talk and short workshop on
Test Driven Development using Ruby, and will also have a short workshop
to take us through the test-driven development approaches that he uses

Foodstuffs
----------

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring
some beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so
we recommend bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the
food. No one will be denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to
chip-in, though.
