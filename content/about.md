ChicagoLUG is made up of local sysadmins, developers, enthusiasts and educators
who want to learn more about Linux and Linux-related projects. We favor
free / libre open-source software, and balance discussions of desktop-related
topics with server and automation-related topics.

## Meetings

We typically meet once a month, and our meetings usually include two
30-60 minute prepared talks and additional time for discussion and socializing.
Though our talks tend to be technical, we strive to remain accessible to
newcomers. If we don't have a meeting planned for the month, it is common for regular
members to gather at a coffee shop for project work and socializing.

## History of ChicagoLUG

ChicagoLUG has existed in various forms since 2005, getting its original start
via the Linux User Group at the Illinois Institute of Technology. The LUG has
existed in its current form since 2012.
